"""
LOVE CALCULATOR CONCEPT:

The Love Calculator is a fun program that evaluates the compatibility between two people based on their names.
It works by counting the occurrences of specific letters in both names to create two scores:
- "TRUE" score: Based on the letters 'T', 'R', 'U', and 'E'
- "LOVE" score: Based on the letters 'L', 'O', 'V', and 'E'

These scores are combined to form a "love percentage." For example:
- If the 'TRUE' score is 3 and the 'LOVE' score is 4, the love score becomes "34."

The resulting score is interpreted as follows:
- Less than 20: "Your love score is like coke and mentos!"
- Between 20 and 50: "You have an average love score."
- Between 50 and 80: "You have a good love score!"
- Over 80: "You two are an outstanding couple!"

This version of the program also includes:
1. A heart graphic to make the output visually appealing.
2. A "processing" animation to simulate calculation.
3. Fun and personalized messages based on the love score.

NOTE:
This program is purely for entertainment and does not reflect actual compatibility!
